# Logging

ScribeForge uses the standard-library `logging` module behind a shared
`scribeforge` logger (`src/scribeforge/observability.py`). Library code stays
silent unless the application configures it; the CLI configures it on every
invocation.

```bash
# Console shows warnings and errors only, so stdout/stderr contracts are undisturbed.
scribeforge status --store Book.scribeforge

# Raise verbosity and keep a rotating, redacted log file.
scribeforge --log-level debug --log-file run.log process book.pdf --store Book.scribeforge
```

- `--log-level` accepts `debug`, `info` (default), `warning`, `error`. The level
  applies to the logger and to the log file.
- `--log-file PATH` attaches a `RotatingFileHandler` (5 MiB per file, 3 backups).
  Parent directories are created as needed.
- Every handler uses `RedactingFormatter`: the user's home directory is replaced
  with `~` in each rendered line (tracebacks included), so log files are safe to
  attach to bug reports.
- `configure_logging()` is idempotent: repeated calls replace handlers instead of
  duplicating output.

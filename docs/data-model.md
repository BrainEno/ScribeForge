# Data Model

SQLite is the source of truth for project state. Original source files remain immutable.

Core entities:
- `projects`: book identity, source URI/hash, status, timestamps
- `pages`: project/page index, source image reference, dimensions, preprocessing metadata
- `engine_runs`: engine/version/config, page, status, timings
- `blocks`, `lines`, `tokens`: hierarchical OCR geometry and text evidence
- `verification_runs`: immutable comparisons between two OCR engine runs
- `alignments`: relationships between evidence produced by independent engines
- `alignment_conflicts`: character-range disagreements within an aligned pair
- `risks`: reason codes and score for an aligned pair
- `review_candidates`: risky evidence regions queued for VLM/human review
- `decisions`: accepted text, actor (automatic/VLM/human), timestamp, rationale/evidence refs
- `jobs`: stage, page scope, state, attempts, error, timing
- `exports`: format, verified revision, path/hash

Coordinates use a normalized page coordinate system in addition to engine-native geometry.

A decision never deletes engine evidence. Corrections create/replace the decision layer while source OCR remains immutable.

## Implemented persistence slices

Schema version 1 persists `projects`, `pages`, `engine_runs`, `ocr_lines`, `ocr_tokens`, and append-only `decisions` with foreign-key protection. Recording another OCR pass creates a new engine run rather than updating old OCR rows. Decision history stores explicit evidence references and does not mutate source OCR text.

Schema version 2 adds append-only `verification_runs`, `alignments`, `alignment_conflicts`, `risks`, and `review_candidates`. Each verification run references the exact two immutable OCR engine runs that produced it. Recomputing alignment/risk creates a new verification run instead of overwriting the previous comparison. Version 1 databases migrate forward without deleting existing projects or OCR evidence.

`jobs` and `exports` remain planned and will be added through later versioned migrations rather than destructive database resets.
